# Initial Node.js Server Setup

This repository provides an initial setup for a Node.js server, serving as a foundation for developing web applications and APIs using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript. It includes essential configurations, middleware, and error handling to help you kickstart your project quickly.

## Features

- **Express Framework**: The server is built on the Express framework, which offers a fast and minimalist approach to building web applications and APIs.
- **Middleware Stack**: The setup includes commonly used middleware components such as CORS, Helmet, Morgan, and Compression, enabling you to enhance security, logging, and performance effortlessly.
- **Error Handling**: An error controller is implemented to handle and format errors, providing consistent and user-friendly error responses.
- **TypeScript Support**: The server setup is written in TypeScript, allowing for static type checking and improved code maintainability.
- **Development Environment**: The setup includes tools like Nodemon and TypeScript compiler, enabling automatic restarts and real-time TypeScript transpilation for a smooth development experience.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/initial-nodejs-server-setup.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies using either npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install

   # Using yarn
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the server in development mode:

   ```bash
   yarn run dev
   ```

   This command will start the server using Nodemon, which automatically restarts the server whenever changes are detected. You can access the server at `http://localhost:3030`.
